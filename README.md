# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aiden, a student developer who enjoys reading, playing chess, thinking, and (obviously) programming. I am also very interested in math, physics, astronomy, finance, business, economics, sociology, and science as a whole (my team won fourth place in our category at Regeneron ISEF 2022). I also really enjoy extracurriculars such as [debate](https://xkcd.com/1432/), soccer, basketball, and pretty much all sports! I am entirely self taught, with a particular interest in open source software, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
