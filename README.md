# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ #

I'm Aiden, a student developer who enjoys reading, playing chess, thinking, and (obviously) programming. I am also very interested in math, physics, astronomy, finance, business, economics, and science as a whole (my team won fourth place in our category at Regeneron ISEF 2022). I also really enjoy extracurricualrs such as debate, soccer, basketball, and pretty much all sports! I am entirely self taught, with a particular interest in open source software, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  * SCRNet, a CNN that recognizes 9 different types of skin cancer
  * MAP, an LSTM neural network that predicts the content of a Medium article based on a title
  * SSPNet, a network that predicts the popularity of a song on Spotify
  * Lots of other projects!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  * Python (as always)
  * Rust (as always)
  * Tensorflow
  * Pytorch
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  * Finance, space, physics, economics, philosophy, literature (books, comics, journals, everything), current events, etc.
  * Whatever!
